1) create an object / Enum with the established actions 

2) create parameters for the weighted values to influences object variables 

3) create an initial thinking process that is random, 
and ensure the weighted values are adding up to 1. 
then also add a point value to each failure and action it gets right, 
using a point system. every time the ai gets the right answer the scores becomes higher, 
and stores the success path. for every time it gets the wrong value, 
it gives a negative score to the ai. and then with the failure change the weighted values. 
however initially, we may need to store the failed attempts, 
because it wont get to the right answer otherwise. 

4) create a method that grabs the actions and the weighted values and store them into a file 

5) once enough information has been gathered, have an alternate condition that states that, 
if x amount of data has been collected, or if the success rate of 
said action is above 60% then use this information and default to the data within the storage. 
by grabbing the values from the stored data, then modify the object variables to those variables, 
then it makes the same decision based on the modification 

6) once this proves to be successful, create an alternative condition that separates 
every new object detected within the robots instance life time (when it turns off and on). 
so if it detects going right at object 1 is successful most of the time, it does that, 
but then it then creates a new batch of information once it reaches step 2, 
in which it defaults to the randomness until the data helps it achieve desirable outcomes
