1. research how to have the nodalMCU esp8266 12e connect and communicate 
with the arduino and vise versa

2. research how to create a reinforcement learning (RL) AI

3. research how to change the storage and limits of the AI

4. research how to use the wifi modual to ensure the data given and outputted 
by the AI is what is intended

5. find ways to reduce the global ram, IRAM, and flash if needed

6. for better memory storage, research how to use the wifi shield modual can connect to the esp,
to allow the ai to pull from a larger memory file. or see if the esp can use wifi to 
communicate with other devices

7. research how to drive the robot, and collect data for the ai; 
before the ai learns to drive itself

8. test the limits of the RL AI, by testing the max amount of inputs it can handle, 
text it can read in the memory bank, etc.

9. reduce and finalize the code it possible, less ram and memory the better; 
gives better opportunity for the ai to learn from its mistakes.
